# Book-Information
Automatically download information on any book with only a title as input. 

# How to use
Run `main.py`. Enter your intended book's title as you would in a search engine. A collection of data about the book will be scraped from GoodReads. Unfortunately, sometimes the `author` (and sometimes others) is not able to be fetched. This is to be fixed.
